A pententration testing or pentest is an authorized simulated attack performed on a computer system to evaluate its security. It can be performed wirelessly or physically.

The different types ff Penetration Testing :
```
Network Services
Web Application
Social Engineering (phishing, whaling, Honeytraps (romance scams) etc )
Physical (usb or other devices specially designed for pentest like )
```  

## The standart methodology of pentesting

</p>

in this case, we will use a targeted attack on an email address found on instagram, we don't need to pass trought the classic method.
How will we do that and what do we need to? before going forth we need to know what the following means

```
Mail Phishing        = a fake mail containing a malicious file to infect server or computers
Spoofing             = hiding real info and showing fake
Social engineering   = an act that influence the action of a person that may be not in her best intrest
Command and Control  = framework that takes wireless control of a computer and command
```
We will use a Command-and-Control (C2) framework in order to gain acces and maintain persistence in the targets machine, we need 3 tools:
```
Listener (receive respons from agent)
Stager   (malicious payload who set's Agent)
Agent    (maintains connection with Listener)
```
<p align="center">
  <img width=" " height=" " src="https://github.com/XxMordRedxX/PenTestProject/blob/main/Gif/pwerempire.gif">
</p>
The first thing to set up is the Listener, who will receive info from the infected target.
Second is Stager a malicious piece of code in form of a file that will set a Agent and establish a connection between Agent and Listener
once its executed on the targeted computer. As You can see, we have our Listener and Stager(launcher.bat) ready,
now we will send it to the target using Mail Phishing and Social Engineering.

There are different C2 frameworks open source and commercial like CobaltStrike, Apfel, Covenant, Merlin and much more with their
special features, in our case, we will use the Powershell-Empire and Starkiller, who are unsupported sinds 2015 and not so much
efficient with time, but this is not important in our case, they're symbolically chosen to pay homage to Star Wars.
