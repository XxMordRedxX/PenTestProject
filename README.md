# PenTestProject
----------------

## Introduction

an authorized simulated attack performed on a computer system to evaluate its security.

Types Of Penetration Testing

The different types of penetration testing include:

    Network Services
    Web Application
    Client Side
    Wireless
    Social Engineering
    Physical Penetration Testing
    
in our case, we will use a targeted attack on an email adress found on instagram, 
How will we do that and what do we need to? 

Mail Phishing        = a fake mail containing a malicious file to infect server or computers
Spoofing             = hiding real info and showing fake 
Social engineering   = an act that influence the action of a person that may be not in her best intrest
Command and Control  = take wireless unautorized control of a computer


We will use a Command-and-Control (C2) framework in order to gain and maintain persistence in the targets machine, how does it work? we have 3 tools:

    - Listener (receive respons from agent)
    - Stager   (malicious payload who set's Agent)
    - Agent    (maintains connection with Listener)
    
First we will set up a Listener to an ip add, in our case "192.168.123.159" on Port 4321, second step is to create a Stager that will be send to target to create connection, the stager can be different depending on the OS the target uses, MacX, Windows, Linux,  in our case we will choose a windows batch file, so our file will be someting similar to "launcher.bat" once its created, we send it to our victime by using Social Engineering, spoofing and official trusted company mail like google, facebook etc, for expl: (help.desk@facebook.com) and attach that malicious file in a spoofed name, once the file executed we're ready for the command and control.

We have a lot a C2 frameworks like Apfel, Covenant, Merlin and much more with their special features, in our case, we will use the Powershell-Empire and Starkiller, who are unsupported sinds 2015 and not so much efficient with time, but this is not important in our case, they're symbolically chosen to pay homage to Star Wars. 

We first start powershell-empire server and client, create Listener, Stager and send. We can do all that in the terminal emulator or on the graphical user interface Starkiller. Once the file executed, we will see a new "agent" clicking on we will have a lot of command and control options, like send a antivirus free keylogger, webcam spy, exfiltrate files, interactive tasks with the user.
