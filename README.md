A pententration testing or pentest is an authorized simulated attack performed on a computer system to evaluate its security. It can be performed wirelessly or physically.

The different types ff Penetration Testing :
```
Network Services
Web Application
Social Engineering (phishing, whaling, Honeytraps (romance scams) etc )
Physical (usb or other devices specially designed for pentest like )
```  

## The standart methodology of pentesting

</p>

This the standard methodology of a pentest, it can be different depending on what we are targetting and which information we posses about our target,
in this case, the only information we have is an e mail adresse from a facebook profile, our plan is to clone a webpage and attach a malicious file to send it to out target, we will use Social Engineering and mail Phishing. 

```
Mail Phishing        = a fake mail containing a malicious file to infect server or computers
Spoofing             = hiding real info and showing fake
Social engineering   = an act that influence the action of a person that may be not in her best intrest
Command and Control  = framework that takes wireless control of a computer and command
```
We will use a Command-and-Control (C2) framework in order to gain acces and maintain persistence in the targets machine,
we will need the folling tools to begin:
```
Listener (receive respons from agent)
Stager   (malicious payload who set's Agent)
Agent    (maintains connection with Listener)
```
<p align="center">
  <img width=" " height=" " src="https://github.com/XxMordRedxX/PenTestProject/blob/main/Gif/pwerempire.gif">
</p>
The first thing to set up is the Listener, who will receive info from the infected target.
Second is Stager a malicious piece of code in form of a file that will set a Agent and establish a connection between Agent and Listener
once its executed on the targeted computer. As You can see, we have our Listener and Stager(launcher.bat) ready,
now we will send it to the target using Mail Phishing and Social Engineering.

## Command and Control (C2)
There are different C2 frameworks open source and commercial like CobaltStrike, Apfel, Covenant, Merlin and much more with their
special features, in our case, we will use the Powershell-Empire, a powerfull post exploiting framework. by default its controled
in the terminal emulator but there a GUI Starkiller that is more user friendly for the operations.
(also chosen to pay hommage to the Empire)

## Social Engineering
Now that we have our Stager (launcher.bat) hosted, we will attach it to a mail, the idea [TO BE DEFINED]
