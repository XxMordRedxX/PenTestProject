A pententration testing or pentest is an authorized simulated attack performed on a computer system to evaluate its security. It can be performed wirelessly or physically. 

The different types ff Penetration Testing :
```
Network Services
Web Application
Social Engineering (phishing, whaling, Honeytraps (romance scams) etc )
Physical (usb or other devices specially designed for pentest like )
```    
## The standart methodology of pentesting

```
1. Pre-engagement & Planning
    The first step in the penetration testing methodology is to create a plan. A properly curated plan provides a way
    through the complex IT structure of an organization. To begin creating a plan one needs to have a complete
    understanding of the organization and its operations. Also, knowledge of their systems and applications is
    important. Once we have this information.

2. Intelligence Gathering
    To have an effective penetration test, it is necessary to conduct proper reconnaissance and gather intel on the
    systems. By using various tools, automated and manual, testers will check the system to find any potential
    vulnerability or entry points. These would be then exploited by the testers in further steps. Tools such as
    Recon-Ng, Nmap, Spiderfoot, Metasploit, Wireshark, are commonly used for this.

3. Vulnerability Analysis & Exploitation
    Once the potential vulnerabilities are discovered, testers will leverage these to further enter the system. This
    closely resembles how a cybercriminal would exploit these security gaps and helps provide a better understanding.
    All the steps, tools used, location, and methods of entry for a particular issue are properly documented to
    capture the entire process for further review.

4. Solution Development
    Once security vulnerabilities are unearthed, testers will devise strategies and solutions to fix them. in their 
    final reports, solution steps will be compiled for all the issues and additional suggestions to keep the system 
    secure.

5. Report Drafting and Certificate Issuance
    The final stage of a penetration test is reporting. From planning to execution and solution, all details are 
    compiled in a report that is sent out to all the stakeholders. Steps to fix the issues and future steps are also 
    mentioned in this report. The final report should be so made that it is consumable by both technical 
    and non-technical personnel.
```


in our case, we will use a targeted attack on an email address found on instagram,
How will we do that and what do we need to?
```
Mail Phishing        = a fake mail containing a malicious file to infect server or computers
Spoofing             = hiding real info and showing fake
Social engineering   = an act that influence the action of a person that may be not in her best intrest
Command and Control  = take wireless unautorized control of a computer
```
We will use a Command-and-Control (C2) framework in order to gain acces and maintain persistence in the targets machine, how does it work? we have 3 tools:
```
Listener (receive respons from agent)
Stager   (malicious payload who set's Agent)
Agent    (maintains connection with Listener)
```


First we will set up a Listener to an ip add, in our case "192.168.123.159" on Port 4321.
Second step is to create a Stager that will be send to target to create connection, the stager can be different depending on the OS
the target uses, MacX, Windows, Linux,  in our case we will choose a windows batch file.
So our file will be someting similar to "launcher.bat" once its created, we send it to our victime by using Social Engineering.
Spoofing an official trusted company mail like google, facebook etc, for expl: (help.desk@facebook.com) and attach that malicious file in a spoofed name.
Once the file executed we're ready for the command and control.

There are different C2 frameworks open source and commercial like CobaltStrike, Apfel, Covenant, Merlin and much more with their special features, in our case, we will use the Powershell-Empire and Starkiller, who are unsupported sinds 2015 and not so much efficient with time, but this is not important in our case, they're symbolically chosen to pay homage to Star Wars.

We first start powershell-empire server and client, create Listener, Stager and send. We can do all that in the terminal emulator or on the
graphical user interface Starkiller. Once the file executed, we will see a new "agent" clicking on we will have a lot of command and control options,
like send an antivirus-free keylogger, webcam spy, exfiltrate files, interactive tasks with the user.
