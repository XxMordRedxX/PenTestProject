A pententration testing or pentesting is an authorized simulated attack performed on a computer system to evaluate its security. It can be performed wirelessly or physically. 

The different types ff Penetration Testing :

    Network Services
    Web Application
    Social Engineering (phishing, whaling, Honeytraps (romance scams) etc )
    Physical (usb or other devices specially designed for pentest like )

in our case, we will use a targeted attack on an email adress found on instagram,
How will we do that and what do we need to?

Mail Phishing        = a fake mail containing a malicious file to infect server or computers
Spoofing             = hiding real info and showing fake
Social engineering   = an act that influence the action of a person that may be not in her best intrest
Command and Control  = take wireless unautorized control of a computer


We will use a Command-and-Control (C2) framework in order to gain acces and maintain persistence in the targets machine, how does it work? we have 3 tools:

    - Listener (receive respons from agent)
    - Stager   (malicious payload who set's Agent)
    - Agent    (maintains connection with Listener)


First we will set up a Listener to an ip add, in our case "192.168.123.159" on Port 4321.
Second step is to create a Stager that will be send to target to create connection, the stager can be different depending on the OS
the target uses, MacX, Windows, Linux,  in our case we will choose a windows batch file.
So our file will be someting similar to "launcher.bat" once its created, we send it to our victime by using Social Engineering.
Spoofing an official trusted company mail like google, facebook etc, for expl: (help.desk@facebook.com) and attach that malicious file in a spoofed name.
Once the file executed we're ready for the command and control.

We have a lot a C2 frameworks like Apfel, Covenant, Merlin and much more with their special features, in our case, we will use the Powershell-Empire and
Starkiller, who are unsupported sinds 2015 and not so much efficient with time, but this is not important in our case, they're symbolically chosen to pay
homage to Star Wars.

We first start powershell-empire server and client, create Listener, Stager and send. We can do all that in the terminal emulator or on the
graphical user interface Starkiller. Once the file executed, we will see a new "agent" clicking on we will have a lot of command and control options,
like send an antivirus-free keylogger, webcam spy, exfiltrate files, interactive tasks with the user.
